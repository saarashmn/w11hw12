# w11hw12
simplest way to implement k-means to a mixture model. I'm not sure if it covers the requirements for the HW, but this is the best I could come up for.
if the data is well-separated and the number of mixture components is correctly specified, K-means clustering can produce reasonably good cluster assignments that are similar to the "true" mixture.
if the data is noisy or contains outliers, the clustering algorithm may produce suboptimal results.
